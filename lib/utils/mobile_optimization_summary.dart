MOBILE OPTIMIZATION SUMMARY
==========================

This document summarizes all mobile optimization features implemented
to ensure the Flutter application works perfectly on mobile devices.

## RESPONSIVE DESIGN IMPLEMENTATIONS

### 1. LayoutBuilder Usage
- All screens use LayoutBuilder to detect screen size

- Dynamic grid columns based on screen width
- Responsive spacing and padding

### 2. Mobile-Specific Components
- ResponsiveTable: Automatically switches between DataTable and ListView
- Mobile-optimized schedule cards with proper spacing
- Touch-friendly button sizes (minimum 44px touch target)
- Optimized dropdown menus for mobile screens

### 3. Text and Typography
- Flexible text widgets to prevent overflow
- Proper text scaling for different screen sizes
- Ellipsis handling for long text
- Readable font sizes on mobile devices
